# go-etherium-examples
This repository is build to demonstrate Ethernet smart contracts. 

# Introduction 
I am currently developing this repository so you can quickly get involved with etherium smart contract development. This repository will be based on the offical go-etherium repository located here - https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contract-Tutorial this repository go's into depth on commands for our blockchain CLI Geth so I won't do that here. 

Throughout these examples you will hopfully obtain usefull information and insight into the technology and be able to grasp etheriums coding languade Solidity.

# Guide

1. HelloWorld App - Why not start basic!
2. "A Piece Of The Cake!" - This app will demonstrate transactions, basically how to make a purchase and buy a piece of cake!
3. "Stop people getting pieces of cake!" - This smart contract will demonstrate permissions and limitting people purchasing your cake. They can however ask your permission. 


# Setup 

1. Download and install Geth, we use this tool to create the blockchain and run minners to do the work. You can download this executable from https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/ afterwards add the geth executeable to your environment variables so you can easily run commands later on. Once done you can test in command prompt (CMD) with "geth help" command. 

2. Clone the repo and go into the initialise folder. 

3. Once you have geth setup, we need to intialise a blockchain ledger, this is essentially your blockchain solution. Navigate to a folder where you would like to have the blockchain files created and use the following command
