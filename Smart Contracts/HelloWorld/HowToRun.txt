# Create account and start mining

In order to publish smart contracts to the blockchain we need to have workers. These workers are going to want paying for there work.
Firsly inside the command prompt running Geth we want to run the following command to create an account.

`personal.newAccount()`

The above command will prompt you for a password. After this we want to assign the account to the miner.

`miner.setEtherbase(eth.accounts[0])`

Next, let's tell the miner to get to work!

`miner.start()`



# Publishing the smart contracts

1. Go to the remix website http://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Click the run tab at the top right hand corner of the screen.
3. Choose Environment Web3 Provider 
4. use the localhost we setup. http://localhost:8008


We will probably need to unlock the account before we are able to publish the smart contract 
`personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0])`



#Deploying Smart contract

1. Input the solidity code into the code panel and on the right hand side click deploy. 

Issues : Make sure you leave some time for your account to gain some Ether, you need gas to pay for the contract to be stored on the blockchain.
